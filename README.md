This project demonstrates how to use Google Gemini API with LangChain to generate summaries of research abstracts in two distinct styles:

Scientist Summary → Technical, precise, and domain-specific.
News Reporter Summary → Engaging, simple, and accessible to the general public.


Input Abstract:  Quantum computing is emerging as a field that uses principles of quantum mechanics to perform calculations much faster than classical computers. Researchers are exploring its applications in cryptography, optimization, and materials science.



Output:Scientist Summary:    Quantum computing exploits superposition and entanglement to achieve exponential speedups in specific domains like cryptography, optimization, and materials discovery.

News Reporter Summary: Quantum computers could soon solve problems faster than today’s machines, opening new possibilities in banking, healthcare, and materials science.
